        "\n",
        "- *Popularity*: Python is one of the most popular programming languages ([Source](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/blog/most-popular-programming-languages/)) and is extensively used in the financial services industry and asset management.\n",
        "- *Transferable skills*: You will acquire the concepts (such as variables, data types, loops, if-statements, ...), which other programming languages also have. Thus, if you work for a company that happens to use a different programming language, you will be able to transition quickly.\n",
        "- *Package ecosystem*: Python has a rich and well-developed package ecosystem. Packages help you to use code that others have already written, which helps to save a lot of time with common problems.\n",
        "- *Open source*: There is no license required to run Python. Thus, you can run it on as many computers as you like, don't need to renew it, and are not dependent on your university or employer to pay for a subscription.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What can Python be used for in your studies?\n",
        "- Empirical seminar or master theses can be done in Python.\n",
        "- It could be the difference between you getting the internship or someone else.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### What can Python be used for in your future career?\n",
        "- *Data analysis*: Handling, cleaning and analyzing large datasets is very easy.\n",
        "- *Automation*: Due to its flexibility, almost anything can be automated in Python. For example, generating reports from a large number of input files\n",
        "- *Machine learning*: Python is the most popular language for working with (and developing) machine learning models. Just ask ChatGPT \"Which language was ChatGPT programmed in?\" -> Python.\n",
        "- *Asset management*: Many uses in asset management, such as algorithmic trading, backtesting, and portfolio optimization."

        "For your convenience, here are a few examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Starting point for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT_XDTarsjw&t=45s) that explains data types, logic, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [Google's official introduction to Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook?authuser=1) also contains some good introductory examples and explains the usage of the so-called \"notebooks\" and useful keyboard shortcuts\n",

        "- [Overview over pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHHym9neKRs)\n",
        "    - One of Python's main data structures are pandas DataFrames. This video gives you an overview\n",
        "    - Take a look at the [official pandas cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)\n",
        "\n",
        "If you follow a tutorial from YouTube or another source, many recommend installing VSCode, PyCharm, Anaconda, or other programs.\n",
        "While these programs are great, if you are just starting out, Google Colab is the easiest choice.\n",
        "**You can copy the code you have from the other tutorial into a code cell and execute it just like in the other tools.**\n",

        "- [w3school](https://www.w3resource.com/python/python-tutorial.php)\n",

        "\n",
        "<!-- ### How does programming typically work\n",
        "- Use a tutorial to get up and running with the basics\n",
        "- Follow the tutorial and try to *understand* why something is happening / done a certain way\n",
        "- Try to change the code in the tutorials in your own notebook and check whether the outcome is as expected\n",
        "- You will get a hang of the basics\n",

        "  - StackOverflow\n",
        "  - The documentation of the packages, e.g. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)\n",

        "  - It is very good at explaining code, so try to make use of that if you struggle with certain concepts (e.g. data types, functions, ...)\n",
        "    - Example prompt: `I'm using Python. Explain how a for loop works.`\n",
